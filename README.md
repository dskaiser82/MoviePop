### How it Works

MoviePop is an online quiz game covering 3 movies (currently) and 30 questions.
Users watch a movie trailer per movie and answer corresponding questions in their quest 
to reach their highest score (out of 30).

2 Players
The start screen let's the user(s) choose 1 or two player.  If the game is two players, player 1 and 2 switch turns every 5 questions.  Just like the single player game, 
MoviePop features 30 questions and 10 questions per movie.
